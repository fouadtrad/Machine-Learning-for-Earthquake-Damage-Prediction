# Machine-Learning-for-Earthquake-Damage-Prediction

This repository contains the code needed to build a model that predicts the damage level caused by an earthquake on a building. 

The dataset used is the Nepal Earthquake Dataset available on Driven Data https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/

The final model is deployed with Gradio and can be accessed through the following link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/fouadtrad/MSBA315.
